# github-web-scraper

A web scraper that scraps your profile. Just enter your username and it'll list your:

- bio
- location
- followers
- following
- repos
- stars

It uses Python for the scraping and Java for the parsing, with Bash to provide a smooth interaction between the two.

Try it out [here](github-web-scraper.dynamicsquid.repl.run)!
